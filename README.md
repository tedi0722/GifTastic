# GifTastic
### Overview
This application uses JavaScript and the GIPHY API that allows users to search for gifs.

* Random Inspiration:
Many popular websites these days such as reddit, youtube, 9gag are implementing "dark theme." I was curious as to why and did some research. I found out that the reason behind this is because of our eyes. Research shows that dark screens with dim/faded colors are better for human eyes because it reflects less light.
